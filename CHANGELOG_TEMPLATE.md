<!--
CHANGELOG ENTRY TEMPLATE
========================
Copy the block below into CHANGELOG.md under `## [Unreleased]` for every
release, then fill it in. Rules:

- Headings map 1:1 from Conventional Commits — a release notes diff should be
  a group-by of commit types:
    feat   -> Added       fix -> Fixed   perf -> Changed
    refactor -> Changed   deprecate -> Deprecated   remove -> Removed
    security -> Security
  `docs:` and `chore:` commits do NOT get bullets here unless user-visible
  (a README rewrite that changes documented behavior is a `Changed` bullet).
- Audience check before adding a bullet: would a plugin *user* care? If only
  developers care, leave it out (or fold it into a `Changed` line like
  "internal refactor, no behavior change").
- Every bullet: what changed + why it matters, in that order. Reference the
  upstream issue/PR number where one exists (e.g. `(#42)`).
- Breaking changes get a `### Breaking` block at the top of the release, and
  the version bump is major.
